# PolaritonSqueezing
Data and code for the paper 'Cavity engineering of Hubbard U via phonon polaritons' by Brieuc Le De, Christian J. Eckhardt, Dante M. Kennes and Michael A. Sentef.

## How to reproduce plots in the paper

In this repository the code to reproduce the spectral functions - Fig. 4 - is contained.
To reproduce the plot in the paper simply execute `main_plot.py` - the needed data is contained in the `DATA/` directory.
The c++ code can be compiled using `make`.
